vai is a command-line tool to allow you to open files in any subdirectory
without knowing its precise location.

- 'vai' should be moved to a location in your PATH such as /usr/bin

- 'etc_vai' should be moved to /etc/vai and modified for your favourite editor
    and any directories you want it to exclude
- 'bash_vai' should be moved to /etc/bash_completion.d/vai to allow
    tab-completion to work
